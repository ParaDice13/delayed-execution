# delayed-execution
This script allows the user to delay the execution of a command, e.g. to shut down their machine after a set amount of time.

## FAQ

**Why not just use 'sleep 1h; your_command'?**

This script is geared towards users who have little to no experience with the command line. Novice users can use the GUI to simply delay tasks on their machine.

**Which operating systems are supported?**

This script should run on all Unix-based operating systems, including Linux, MacOS, and BSD. So far, it has only been _tested_ on Linux though.
